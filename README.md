This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications involving the use of `useEffect`, `setTimeout`, and `setState`. The bug causes unexpected behavior where state updates within a `setTimeout` called from `useEffect` don't always render correctly.  The solution showcases a pattern to correctly update state in these situations.
