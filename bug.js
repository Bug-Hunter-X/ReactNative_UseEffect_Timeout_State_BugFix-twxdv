This bug occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a callback function that attempts to modify state using `setState` within a `setTimeout` function.  The problem arises because `setState` might not work correctly if called outside of the React Native event loop. This is common when trying to update state in a delayed fashion.
